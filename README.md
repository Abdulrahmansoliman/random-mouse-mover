# random-mouse-mover

## Purpose:

I created this script to make mouse movements when I go AFK in games so it prevents me from getting ban.


This script uses the PyAutoGUI library to simulate random mouse movements on a computer screen. The script generates random coordinates within the screen resolution and moves the mouse cursor to that position using the pyautogui.moveTo() function with a duration of 0.5 seconds. The script then pauses for 2 seconds before generating new coordinates and repeating the process.
